				The name that can be named is not the eternal name. <br>
				The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth. <br>
				The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. <br>
				Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. <br>
				Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. <br>
				These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. <br>
				Darkness within darkness. <br>
				The gate to all mystery.</p>

					Therefore having and not having arise together. <br>
  				Difficult and easy complement each other. <br>
	   			Long and short contrast each other: <br>
					High and low rest upon each other; <br>
					Voice and sound harmonize each other; <br>
					Front and back follow one another.

					Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking. <br>
					The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease, <br>
					Creating, yet not possessing. <br>
					Working, yet not taking credit. <br>
					Work is done, then forgotten. <br>
					Therefore it lasts forever.
