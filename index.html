				<p class="mx-auto mt-5" style="max-width: 420px">The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. <br>
				The name that can be named is not the eternal name. <br>
				The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth. <br>
				The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. <br>
				Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. <br>
				Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. <br>
				These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. <br>
				Darkness within darkness. <br>
				The gate to all mystery.</p>

					Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. <br>
				All can know good as good only because there is evil.

				<p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 420px">
					Therefore having and not having arise together. <br>
  				Difficult and easy complement each other. <br>
	   			Long and short contrast each other: <br>
					High and low rest upon each other; <br>
					Voice and sound harmonize each other; <br>
					Front and back follow one another.
				</p>
				<p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 420px">
					Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking. <br>
					The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease, <br>
					Creating, yet not possessing. <br>
					Working, yet not taking credit. <br>
					Work is done, then forgotten. <br>
					Therefore it lasts forever.

					Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling. <br>
					Not collecting treasures prevents stealing. <br>
					Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.	
				</p>

				<p class="mx-auto mt-5">
					The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones. <br>
					If men lack knowledge and desire, then clever people will not try to interfere. <br>
					If nothing is done, then all will be well.

					Untangle the knot, <br>
					Soften the glare, <br>
					Merge with dust. <br>
					Oh, hidden deep but ever present! <br>

					The space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows. <br>
					The shape changes but not the form; <br>
					The more it moves, the more it yields. <br>
					More words count less. <br>
					Hold fast to the center.

					Why do heaven and Earth last forever? <br>
					They are unborn, <br>

					The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. <br>
					He is detached, thus at one with all. <br>
					Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.

					It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao.

				<p class="mx-auto mt-5">
					In dwelling, be close to the land. <br>
					In meditation, go deep in the heart. <br>
					In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. <br>
					In speech, be true. <br>
					In ruling, be just. <br>
					In daily life, be competent. <br>
					In action, be aware of the time and the season.

					Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow. <br>
					Retire when the work is done. <br>
					This is the way of heaven.

					Carrying body and soul and embracing the one, <br>
					Can you avoid separation? <br>
					Attending fully and becoming supple, <br>
					Can you be as a newborn babe? <br>
					Washing and cleansing the primal vision, <br>
					Can you be without stain? <br>
					Loving all men and ruling the country, <br>
					Can you be without cleverness? <br>
					Opening and closing the gates of heaven, <br>
					Can you play the role of woman? <br>
					Understanding and being open to all things, <br>
					Are you able to do nothing? <br>
					Giving birth and nourishing, <br>
					Bearing yet not possessing, <br>
					Working yet not taking credit, <br>
					Leading yet not dominating, <br>
					This is the Primal Virtue.
