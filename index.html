					The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow. <br>
					The high is lowered, and the low is raised. <br>
					If the string is too long, it is shortened; <br>
					If there is not enough, it is made longer.

					The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much and give to those who do not have enough. <br>
					Man's way is different. <br>
					He takes from those who do not have enough and give to those who already have too much. <br>
					What man has more than enough and gives it to the world? 
	Only the man of Tao.

					Therefore the sage works without recognition. <br>
					He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it. <br>
					He does not try to show his knowledge.

					Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water. <br>
					Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better; <br>
					It has no equal. <br>
					The weak can overcome the strong; <br>
					The supple can overcome the stiff. <br>
					Under heaven everyone knows this, <br>
					Yet no one puts it into practice. <br>
					Therefore the sage says: <br>
					He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them. <br>
					He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe. <br>
					The truth often sounds paradoxical.

					After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain. <br>
					What can one do about it? <br>
					Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain <br>
					But does not exact his due. <br>
					A man of Virtue performs his part, <br>
					But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations. <br>
					The Tao of heaven is impartial. <br>
					It stays with good men all the time.

					A small country has fewer people. <br>
					Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed. <br>
					The people take death seriously and do not travel far. <br>
					Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them. <br>
					Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them. <br>
					Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing. <br>
					Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure; <br>
					They are happy in their ways. <br>
					Though they live within sight of their neighbors, <br>
					And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, <br>

					The Tao of the sage is work without effort.
